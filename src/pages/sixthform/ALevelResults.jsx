            Celebrating A Level Success at Bentley Wood
          </h3>

          <p>
            We are absolutely delighted to celebrate the incredible
            achievements of our students in their A Level results this year.
            Their success is a testament to the consistent effort, determination,
            and positive attitude they have shown throughout their studies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our students have worked exceptionally hard, overcoming challenges
            and staying focused on their goals. At the heart of this success are
            our <strong>CARE values</strong> - Communication, Achievement,
            Respect, and Empathy. These core principles have guided our students
            not just in their academic work but in how they've supported each
            other, built strong relationships, and grown as individuals. Many
            students left school today excited by the courses, universities and
            careers that lie ahead of them â€” we wish them all the very best.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every result achieved represents the growth, resilience, and
            dedication of our students and the strong support and guidance of
            our school community with <strong>83% of all grades</strong>{" "}
            achieved grade C or above. Special congratulations to many students
            who achieved <strong>A*/A grades</strong> across three or more A
            Level subjects and to our BTEC students who achieved top grades of
            <strong> Distinction</strong> and <strong>Distinction*</strong>{" "}
            across their qualification.
          </p>

          <p className="text-blue-700 font-semibold text-lg md:text-xl">
            Congratulations to the Year 13 BWHS Class of 2025 - your future is
