          <p className="mb-4">
            Bentley Wood is committed to delivering the governmentâ€™s Prevent Duty.
            The Prevent duty requires a wide range of bodies, including all
            schools, early years and later years childcare providers, to have due
            regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism
            and extremism. Students are educated about the dangers of
            radicalisation and the techniques used by those who seek to recruit
            young people into extremist groups.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Students are encouraged to develop and express their opinions
            throughout their lessons and through a comprehensive PSHE curriculum.
            This creates a culture where extreme views are exposed and can be
            challenged in a safe and secure environment.
